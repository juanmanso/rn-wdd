# Widget Driven Development in React Native

## 👋 Introduction

This repo's main goal is to spike, research and test the feasibility and ease of use of the Widget Driven Development (WDD) approach in React Native.

For more information about the approach, look into the [`docs`](./docs) to read more about it.

## 🏃 How to run the app

1. **Run `yarn install`**

This will install both runtime project dependencies and developer tools listed in `package.json`

2. [Optional] **Run `yarn start`**

Starts the Metro bundler server that loads the app on our devices for development (both virtual and physical devices)

3. **Run `yarn ios` and/or `yarn android`**

It builds the app iOS and Android respectively. If no physical devices are bound, emulators or simulators are opened to do so. Also, if the development server was not already running, it starts it on a new terminal window.
